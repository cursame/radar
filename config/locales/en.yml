Therefore, we find that there is a great need to become involved in actions against school violence. </p><p> For students to interact with eachother with an educational purpose, we consider that an atmosphere of possitive coexistance is required, allowing a collaborative learning process to take place. </p><p>  Cúrsame knows that if the conditions previously mentioned are achieved, we will be able to integrate our technological  platform into  the school system as an efficient way to favour  positive place encounters to improve the teaching-learning process. </p>"
